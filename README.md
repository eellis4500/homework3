One-stop shop password generating website.

This site works pretty flawlessly, and is a fantastic way of creating a auto-generated password. You can select a length between 8 and 128 characters in length. You can also select how difficult you want your password to be, by including special characters along with the standard numbers and upper and lowercase letters.

Below is a image of what the site looks like. You click the button and prompts will ask you for the paramters you want for your password. The randomized password will appear in the field.
